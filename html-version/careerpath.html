              <h3>Hey, I'm Sani 👋</h3>
              <p>
                A software engineer who loves identifying real-world problems and crafting smart, meaningful solutions. 
                I worked as a Project Specialist at Kehittämisyhtiö Witas Oy, which perfectly matched my passion for 
                innovation, collaboration, and turning creative ideas into real results.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>My Focus Areas:</strong> AI agents, automation, vibe coding, AI content creation, AI digital 
                marketing, and development using AI. I've immersed myself in AI, but in a positive and productive way.

                <h4>The -30°C Reality Check</h4>
                <p>
                  Arriving in Finland in the dead of winter at -30 degrees Celsius with a two-year-old child was a 
                  visceral shock—both climatically and professionally. Like many international talents, I sought shelter 
                  in academia, enrolling in language courses and then a Master's degree. But I quickly learned that a 
                  Finnish degree alone isn't the silver bullet for employment.
                </p>
                <p class="journey-insight">
                  <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Academic excellence in a vacuum is insufficient. In Finland's "hidden job market," 
                  social capital is the primary currency.
                </p>
              </div>

                <h4>High Scores Are Only Half the Battle</h4>
                <p>
                  Achieving high scores in my ICT Master's program at JAMK did nothing to alleviate professional isolation. 
                  When courses are remote and online, students lose the opportunity for accidental professional endorsements—those 
                  organic interactions that build trust.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "The first year was hard, full of stress and hard work." If you spend 60 hours a week on coursework and 
                  zero hours on market visibility, you're devaluing your own brand.
                </p>
                <p class="journey-insight">
                  <strong>The Reality:</strong> High scores are merely a baseline; without a network, they are invisible. 
                  Remote learning doesn't just hinder networking; it kills the "visibility" required for a referral.
                </p>

                <h4>The Geography of Opportunity</h4>
                <p>
                  Most international graduates fail because they restrict their search to major urban centers. Through the 
                  JAMK Talent Boost program, I shifted from passive applications to active "career trips," physically visiting 
                  regional companies in places like Viitasaari.
                </p>
                <p class="journey-insight">
                  <strong>Strategic Move:</strong> Smaller municipalities are often more desperate for specialized talent and 
                  offer a faster track to integration. By visiting regional companies, you stop being a name on a PDF and start 
                  being a solution to a local business need. Integration requires "knowing your surroundings" and recognizing 
                  that your skills might be the exact answer for a firm 100 kilometers away that is overlooked by your peers.

                <h4>The Hackathon as a High-Stakes Audition</h4>
                <p>
                  The Viitasaari Hackathon was the strategic pivot that changed my trajectory. Traditional applications are static, 
                  but a hackathon is a live demonstration of agility, craft, and collaborative problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Hackathons function as high-stakes auditions, allowing you to "de-risk" yourself in the eyes of an employer. 
                  They provide a platform to demonstrate real-time problem-solving that a CV can never replicate. For international 
                  talent, these events are the most efficient bridge between academic theory and professional trust.
                </p>
                <p class="journey-insight">
                  <strong>The Direct Path to Employer Trust:</strong> A hackathon isn't just a competition; it's your chance to 
                  show what you can do under pressure, in real-time, with real people watching.

                <h4>The 100km Commute: Investing in Hope</h4>
                <p>
                  I accepted a trainee position at Digikeskus (Witas Company) that offered zero university credits and required 
                  a 100-kilometer commute from Jyväskylä. While many students refuse any work that doesn't count toward their 
                  degree, I knew this was my chance to prove my value.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "The trainee takes nearly 3 months without any university credits... no credits, no points, just wish, interest, 
                  and hope."
                </p>
                <p class="journey-insight">
                  <strong>The Result:</strong> This wasn't a loss of time; it was a three-month "test drive." Strategic integration 
                  requires "closing your eyes to the distance" when the office culture and professional alignment are right. While 
                  on vacation, I saw a vacancy for the remainder of the project and dared to apply. That proactive move, built on 
                  a successful trainee period, secured me the contract.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>The Lesson:</strong> Securing a job is not the finish line—it is, as I learned, the "starting line of the 
                  race to growth and success." The narrator didn't just wait for the role to evolve; proactive daring is what secures 
                  the contract.

                <h4>Sharing the Journey: ELY-Keskus Presentation</h4>
                <p>
                  I was honored to receive an invitation from ELY-Keskus to share my success story as an international student 
                  in Finland. My message was simple: <strong>the path from student to professional is built through connection 
                  and opportunity.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  My journey began as a student at JAMK University of Applied Sciences, where I actively participated in the 
                  Talent Boost program. Events like 'Meet and Greet' and especially a pivotal hackathon were instrumental. 
                  It was during one of these events that I first connected with Digikeskus in Viitasaari—a company I immediately 
                  aspired to work for.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This connection wasn't just a chance; it was a catalyst. With the invaluable help and support from the 
                  Kehittämisyhtiö Witas Oy teams, that initial meeting and aspiration turned into a concrete job offer.
                </p>
                <p class="journey-insight">
                  <strong>My Message to Students:</strong> These programs and events are more than just items on a calendar. 
                  They are genuine pathways to meaningful careers. Sharing this story was my way of showing current international 
                  students that persistence and networking facilitate success.

                  Being a project specialist means connecting people, technology, and business together—from the very first 
                  idea to the final delivery. I work hands-on with both software development and project management, helping 
                  teams and companies transform their digital goals into successful outcomes.

                  Mentoring and motivating students to reach their goals is something I'm truly passionate about. With nearly 
                  a decade of experience working with clients, I've developed a strong ability to consult, advise, and align 
                  software solutions with customer goals. I love the process of listening, brainstorming, and finding that 
                  "aha!" moment where everything starts to make sense.

                <p>
                  Every day, I test new AI tools and technologies to explore how they can help people start new businesses, 
                  grow existing ones, or fill the gaps in their work processes. Yes — AI is a big part of my life. I use it 
                  every minute, but I never fully rely on it. I believe that when the human brain and AI creativity work 
                  together, BOOM 💥 — faster, smarter, and more innovative results appear.
